## Getting Started

This project is a monorepo managed with [Yarn workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/workspaces/).

You can find all the FireCMS packages in the `packages` folder.
The code that simulates a final project implemented by a user can be found in the `examples` folder.

All dependencies are linked automatically and just running the following commands should be enough to get you started.

After pulling the code you just need to run:

```bash
yarn
yarn dev
``` 
to start the demo project.

You can also run:
```bash
yarn
yarn pro
``` 
to use the example project with the Pro version of FireCMS.
