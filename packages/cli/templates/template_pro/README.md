## FireCMS PRO starter template

Welcome to FireCMS!

This is a starter template for your next project. It includes the basic
configuration to get you started.

In order to run this project, you will need to create a Firebase project,
create a web app and copy the configuration to the `firebase_config.ts`.
(but it is likely it was configured for you already).

Then simply run:

### Running the project

Install the dependencies:

```bash
yarn
```

And run the project locally:
```bash
yarn dev
```

### Building the project

Make sure you update your `package.json` `build` script with the correct
project name. Then run:

```bash
yarn build
```

### Deploying the project

You can deploy the project to Firebase hosting by following [these instructions](https://firecms.co/docs/pro/deployment).
In order to deploy the project, you need to have a valid FireCMS PRO license.
You can create one in the [FireCMS subscriptions](https://app.firecms.co/subscriptions).
When you get your API key, you can set it in the `.env` file.
