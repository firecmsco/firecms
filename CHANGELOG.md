in the collection view. The default mode continues to be `side_panel`. There has been a big navigation revamp to
accommodate all the new use cases.
- **Scroll preservation**: When you open an entity in a full-screen view, the scroll position of the collection view is preserved.

that live in their own tab. Secondary forms are built as custom components and can include any components, including
field bindings.

  `userManagementController` can be used as an auth controller, but with all the added logic for user management.

```typescript
    /**

});
```

  This is now handled by the data source. If you need to allow multiple filters, you can use the
