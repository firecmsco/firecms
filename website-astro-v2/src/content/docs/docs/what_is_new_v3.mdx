The new version of FireCMS is a major release that brings a lot of new features
and improvements. This page will guide you through the most important changes ðŸ”¥

FireCMS 3.0 comes in three flavors: **FireCMS Cloud**, **FireCMS Community** and **FireCMS PRO**.

## FireCMS Cloud

FireCMS Cloud makes now use of a **backend** to provide a more flexible and
customizable experience. This backend is hosted by us, and you don't have to
worry about it. You can still use FireCMS Cloud for free, but you will have to
pay for some features.

Until now, FireCMS was a frontend-only library that would connect directly to
the client-side Firebase SDK. This was great for simple use cases, but it
limited the flexibility of the library. For example, it was not possible to
customize collections from the UI, since they were hard coded in the clients
code.

Having a backend allows us to store configuration in Firestore, and to make it easy for end users
to modify the schemas. We have done a lot of work to **prevent polluting your database** with
FireCMS' configuration.

Having a backend also allows us to provide a better experience by offering additional features
such as data enhancement through OpenAI and Google's latest models.

## FireCMS PRO

FireCMS PRO is a version of FireCMS that you can host yourself. This means that
you have full control over your data, and you can customize the CMS to your
needs. You can try out FireCMS PRO for free, but you will need a license to use.

FireCMS PRO is great for large projects, or when you need to customize the CMS
to your needs. You can achieve the highest level of customization of all previous FireCMS versions.

FireCMS PRO is perfect for agencies that are looking to provide a CMS to their clients.
If you are an agency, feel free to [reach out to us](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/appointments/schedules/AcZssZ0INW8ihjQ90S4gkdo8_rbL_Zx7gagZShLIpHyW43zDXkQDPole6a1coo1sT2O6Gl05X8lxFDlp?gv=true)
to get a demo of FireCMS PRO.


## FireCMS Community

FireCMS Community is a free and open source version of FireCMS that you can
host yourself. This means that you have full control over your data, and you can
customize the CMS to your needs.

MIT licensed and completely free, FireCMS Community is a great option for
small projects that just need a CMS. It does not include all the bells and whistles
of FireCMS Cloud or FireCMS PRO, but it is still a powerful alternative, due to
its customizability and flexibility.

This version has all the functionality of FireCMS 2.0 but with many of the improvements
of the latest version, so it is great if you are looking to update and benefit from the
UI updates and performance improvements.


## New UI collection schema editor

Until now, the collection schema was defined in the client-side code. This was
great for simple use cases, but it limited the flexibility of the library. For
example, it was not possible to customize collections from the UI, since they
were hard coded in the clients code.

In FireCMS Cloud, **the collection schema is stored in FireCMS backend**, but you are also able to define
your collections in code for greater flexibility. Your end users will be able to modify the
collection schema. Let's say you have a collection of `Posts` and you want to
add a new possible value for the enum `status`. You can now open the collection
editor and add the new value. Even better, FireCMS can find new values and add
them to your schema with one click!

You can still limit the properties that can be modified from the UI, and you
can also define the default values for new documents.

### New data inference

Do you have a few collections in your project, and you want to get started
quickly? FireCMS can now **infer the schema from your data**. This means that
you can get started with FireCMS in a few minutes, without having to write a
single line of code.

## Local text-based search

In previous versions of FireCMS, you could add your external search engine solution
like Algolia or ElasticSearch. This is still possible, but now you can also
**search your data locally**. This means that you can search your data without
having to pay for an external service. This is great for small projects, or
when you are just getting started.

This feature is meant to be used with **small datasets**. If you have a large
dataset, you should still use an external search engine.

## Data import and export

### Export
You now have better control of how your data is **exported**:
- Define the format of your dates
- Define how arrays get serialized in CSV files (assign one column per array item, or
serialize the array as a string)
- Export your data as JSON or CSV.

### Import
You can now **import data** from CSV, JSON or Excel files. This is great for migrating data
from other systems. We incorporate a modern UI that allows to define how the data is imported
and how it is mapped to your collections.

## Tailwind migration and performance improvements

Versions 1.0 and 2.0 of FireCMS were based on Material UI (mui). This was great
for getting started quickly, but it had some drawbacks. The main one was that
**performance was not great**. The styling solution of MUI is based on emotion
which resolves styles at runtime. This means that the browser has to do a lot of
work to resolve the styles. This is not a problem for small applications, but
it can be a problem for large applications.

In FireCMS 3.0 we have migrated to Tailwind CSS. This is a utility-first CSS
framework that allows us to generate a small CSS file with all the styles
resolved at build time. This means that the browser does not have to do any
work to resolve the styles, which results in a **much faster experience**. ðŸš€

## New authentication system

We now provide a new authentication system that allows managing CMS users
and roles from the UI.

If you prefer defining permissions for each collection in code, you can still do it.


## New component library and Icons

We have also created a new component library that you can use to build your own components
(or use it in any project you like really!). You can get it from npm:

```bash
yarn add @firecms/ui
```
(you only need to install it if you want to use it in a different project)

The components are fully typed and documented. You can find the documentation [here](/docs/components).
They are based on Tailwind CSS and Radix UI. They are easily customizable, and you can
use them to build your own components. They are also accessible and responsive.

## Icons collection

You can customise the icons in different parts of the CMS, such when selecting one for
a collection. FireCMS UI now exports all the Material Icons, conveniently exported as React components.

We have also added an [icon search function](/docs/icons) in the website to find the icon you need.

It makes it easy to find the right icon key when defining configuration for your collections, or to
find the right icon component when you want to use it in your own components.

## New CLI

Use the CLI to deploy your custom code with a single command:

```bash
firecms deploy
```
