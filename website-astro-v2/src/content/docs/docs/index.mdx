FireCMS is an **open-source headless CMS and admin panel framework** built with React and TypeScript. It connects directly to your **Firebase** or **MongoDB** project to provide a powerful, intuitive, and type-safe interface for managing your data.
:::

FireCMS is designed to be the fastest way to build a production-ready back-office. It generates full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) views from your data configuration, imposes **no data structure restrictions**, and can be set up in minutes.

## What Can You Build?

FireCMS is flexible enough to be the backend for any project. Common use cases include:

  * **Custom Admin Panels:** Create a type-safe UI for managing your application's data (e.g., users, products, orders) without the frontend hassle.
  * **Internal Tools:** Build bespoke tools for your operations, sales, or support teams to manage workflows, track data, and run internal processes.
  * **Headless CMS:** Power your websites, mobile apps, and marketing content from a single, powerful admin interface.

## Core Developer Features

FireCMS is built by developers, for developers.

### 1\. Schema as Code

Define your data models as TypeScript objects. Your code becomes the single source of truth, enabling version control, type-safety, and a seamless git-based workflow.

### 2\. Instant CRUD UI

FireCMS reads your schema and automatically generates a full-featured, performant, and beautiful CRUD interface with tables, forms, validation, and more.

### 3\. Radical Extensibility

If you can build it in React, you can build it in FireCMS. Create custom form fields, entirely new top-level views, or replace any part of the UI with your own components. No black boxes.
