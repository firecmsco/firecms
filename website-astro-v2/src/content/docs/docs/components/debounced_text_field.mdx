`DebouncedTextField` is a variation of the standard `TextField` component designed to delay the invocation of the
`onChange` callback. This delay helps in reducing the number of `onChange` calls for inputs that may have
frequent updates, such as during typing.

## Usage

To use `DebouncedTextField`, import it from your components. It supports all the `TextField` props including `value`, `onChange` among others.

## Basic DebouncedTextField

This example shows a basic usage of the `DebouncedTextField`, demonstrating how it can be used to handle value changes with a defer mechanism to reduce the number of updates.
