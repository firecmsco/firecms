Collapse components are used to show and hide content. React animation is used for the transition. Use it to toggle visibility of content.

## Usage

To use the `Collapse`, you need to import it from where it's defined, pass children to be displayed within the collapse component, and control its open state. Optionally, you can also customize its duration of the animation.
