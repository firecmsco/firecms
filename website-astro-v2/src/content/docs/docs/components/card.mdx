Cards are surfaces that display content and actions on a single topic. They should be easy to scan for relevant and actionable information. Cards can be used for a wide variety of purposes including to display information, as clickable actions, or as interactive elements of the UI.

## Usage

Import the `Card` from `@firecms/ui` and wrap the content you wish to display on the card. You can also make the card clickable by providing an `onClick` handler.

import CodeSample from "../../src/CodeSample";
import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";

## Basic Card

Represents the basic usage of a card for displaying content.

import CardBasicDemo from '../../samples/components/card/card_basic';
import CardBasicSource from '!!raw-loader!../../samples/components/card/card_basic';

<CodeSample>
    <CardBasicDemo/>
</CodeSample>

<CodeBlock language="tsx">{CardBasicSource}</CodeBlock>

## Clickable Card

Shows a card that has an onClick event, making it behave similar to a button.

import CardClickableDemo from '../../samples/components/card/card_clickable';
import CardClickableSource from '!!raw-loader!../../samples/components/card/card_clickable';

<CodeSample>
    <CardClickableDemo/>
</CodeSample>

<CodeBlock language="tsx">{CardClickableSource}</CodeBlock>

## Custom Styling

Demonstrates how additional classes or styles can be applied to the card for custom appearance.

import CardCustomStyleDemo from '../../samples/components/card/card_custom_style';
import CardCustomStyleSource from '!!raw-loader!../../samples/components/card/card_custom_style';

<CodeSample>
    <CardCustomStyleDemo/>
</CodeSample>

<CodeBlock language="tsx">{CardCustomStyleSource}</CodeBlock>
