Cards are surfaces that display content and actions on a single topic. They should be easy to scan for relevant and actionable information. Cards can be used for a wide variety of purposes including to display information, as clickable actions, or as interactive elements of the UI.

## Usage

Import the `Card` from `@firecms/ui` and wrap the content you wish to display on the card. You can also make the card clickable by providing an `onClick` handler.

import CodeSample from "../../../../components/CodeSample";
import { Code } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

## Basic Card

Represents the basic usage of a card for displaying content.

import CardBasicDemo from '../../samples/components/card/card_basic';
import CardBasicSource from '../../samples/components/card/card_basic?raw';

<CodeSample>
    <CardBasicDemo/>
</CodeSample>

<Code code={CardBasicSource} lang="tsx" />

## Clickable Card

Shows a card that has an onClick event, making it behave similar to a button.

import CardClickableDemo from '../../samples/components/card/card_clickable';
import CardClickableSource from '../../samples/components/card/card_clickable?raw';

<CodeSample>
    <CardClickableDemo/>
</CodeSample>

<Code code={CardClickableSource} lang="tsx" />

## Custom Styling

Demonstrates how additional classes or styles can be applied to the card for custom appearance.

import CardCustomStyleDemo from '../../samples/components/card/card_custom_style';
import CardCustomStyleSource from '../../samples/components/card/card_custom_style?raw';

<CodeSample>
    <CardCustomStyleDemo/>
</CodeSample>

<Code code={CardCustomStyleSource} lang="tsx" />
