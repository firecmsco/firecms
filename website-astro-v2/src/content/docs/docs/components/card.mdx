Cards are surfaces that display content and actions on a single topic. They should be easy to scan for relevant and actionable information. Cards can be used for a wide variety of purposes including to display information, as clickable actions, or as interactive elements of the UI.

## Usage

Import the `Card` from `@firecms/ui` and wrap the content you wish to display on the card. You can also make the card clickable by providing an `onClick` handler.

## Basic Card
