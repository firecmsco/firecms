The `Menu` component provides a flexible dropdown menu functionality. It leverages the `@radix-ui/react-dropdown-menu` for accessibility and customization features. The `Menu` component and its sub-component, `MenuItem`, can be easily styled and incorporated into your UI for various needs such as navigation menus, options menus, and more.

## Usage

The `Menu` component requires a `trigger` element to toggle the visibility of the menu and can accept any ReactNode as its children, which typically includes `MenuItem` components for the menu options.
