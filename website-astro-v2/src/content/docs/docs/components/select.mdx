Select is a form component that provides a dropdown menu for users to choose from among several options. It supports single and multiple selections, customizable styles, and integration with form libraries.

## Usage

To use the `Select` component in your web application, start by importing it along with `SelectItem` for individual
options and `SelectGroup` if you need to group related options together. The `Select` component can be highly
customized to fit your specific user interface requirements. This allows you to control its appearance, such as its
size, shape, and color, to match the overall design of your application. Additionally, you can modify its behavior,
including how it handles user interactions, whether it supports multiple selections, and how it displays selected items.
This level of customization makes it a versatile tool for creating intuitive and responsive dropdown menus
that improve user experience.
