FireCMS 3.0 is a major release that introduces a lot of changes. This page
describes the main changes and how to migrate from FireCMS 2.0.

FireCMS Community and PRO are the self-hosted versions of FireCMS. It allows you to host your own backend and use FireCMS without any restrictions.
It is the most similar version to FireCMS 2.0, but with a lot of improvements and new features.

## Migrating to FireCMS PRO

Most of the concepts are the same as in FireCMS 2.0, but there are some changes that you need to be aware of.
We recommend starting a new project with:
```bash
yarn create firecms-app --pro
```
or
```bash
npx create-firecms-app --pro
```

This will create a new project with the latest version of FireCMS PRO.

## Updating the imports

The main change is that the imports have changed. You need to update the imports in your project.
Before you would import everything from `firecms` (or even `@camberi/firecms`). Now you need to import from
different packages.
- All UI components are now in `@firecms/ui`. Everything including buttons, textfields, layouts, etc.
- The core of FireCMS is in `@firecms/core`. This includes the `FireCMSApp`, `FireCMSContext`, etc.
- All Firebase related code is in `@firecms/firebase`, including `useFirebaseAuthController`, `use` etc.
Most of the imports can be found in `@firecms/core`, so we recommend starting there.

## Collection configuration

Collections have suffered minimal changes. If you don't have any custom components defined, it should be
easy to adapt your collections to the new format.

- You need to define an `id` for each collection, which typically can be the same as the `path`. Make sure the
`id` is unique.

- The prop `views` has been renamed to `entityViews`, since they are applied to entities.
  - Within `entityViews` the prop `path` has been renamed to `key`.

- For `AdditionalFieldDelegate`:
  - The prop `id` has been renamed to `key`.
  - The prop `builder` has been renamed to `Builder`.

## Authenticator

- The authenticator now returns a `dataSourceDelegate` instead of a `dataSource`. The difference is that you do
not pass the `collection` prop anymore.

## Other

- `useNavigationContext` has been renamed to `useNavigationController`.
- `FieldDescription` has been renamed to `FieldCaption`.
- `PropertyPreview` no longer need an `entity` prop.


## Migrating custom components (MUI)

FireCMS 3.0 is based on `tailwindcss` instead of `mui`.

Mui was great for the initial versions of FireCMS, but it was being a big performance bottleneck
and it was hard to customize.

The new version of FireCMS has built in almost 50 new components implemented with tailwindcss, that
mimic in a good way the material-ui components. You are encouraged to migrate your custom components
to the new format.

You can try replacing imports from `@mui/material` to `@firecms/ui` and will see that many things work out of the box.

### Icons

Icons in FireCMS are based on the material icons. You can use all the material icons importing them just like in MUI.

```tsx
import { AddIcon } from "@firecms/ui";
```

The prop `fontSize` is called `size` in FireCMS (because it just makes more sense, MUI).

### Components that have no equivalent:
- `Box`: The box component is just a wrapper used by mui to apply styles. You can use a `div` instead, with some
tailwind classes.
Tip: ChatGPT is great at converting Box components to div with tailwind classes.
- `Link`: Use `a` instead.
- `FormControl`

### Components that change behaviour (from MUI to FireCMS UI)
- `Menu` and `MenuItem`: Menu items do not have an id anymore. You can add an `onClick` props per menu item.
- `Select` does not use `labelId` anymore. Just add the label as a component in `label`.
- `SelectChangeEvent` is now `ChangeEvent<HTMLSelectElement>`
- `CircularProgress` size is a string instead of a number. You can use `size="small"` or `size="large"`.

### Continue using MUI

However, if you want to keep using mui: you can still use the old components, but you will need to
install the `mui` package manually.

```
yarn add @mui/material @emotion/react @emotion/styled
```

If you need MUI icons, run:

```
yarn add @mui/icons-material
```
