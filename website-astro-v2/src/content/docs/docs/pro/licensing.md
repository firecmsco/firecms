Do you have any questions, would like to request a trial, or need a custom license?
Please [contact us via email](mailto:hello@firecms.co),
or [schedule a call](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/appointments/schedules/AcZssZ0INW8ihjQ90S4gkdo8_rbL_Zx7gagZShLIpHyW43zDXkQDPole6a1coo1sT2O6Gl05X8lxFDlp?gv=true).

You can use the FireCMS PRO features locally during development without a license, but you will need to
purchase one to deploy it. There is a grace period after the first deployment
to allow you to test it in production.

You can purchase a license in the [FireCMS subscriptions site](https://app.firecms.co/subscriptions).

When creating your license, you need to specify the project IDs that will be
using the license. You can find your project ID in the Firebase console.

You will receive an API key that you need to pass to your `FireCMS` component.
If you are using a starter template, you can set it in the `.env` file.
