You can check a **demo** of this template:
- [**Admin panel**](https://next.firecms.co/cms)
- [**Frontend**](https://next.firecms.co/products)

You can change the data in the demo and see the updates, but it gets reset every **hour**.

Get a **frontend template** with sample **CRUD views** that include:
- Integration with **Firebase** and **FireCMS**. Reuse components both in frontend and admin panel.
- **Live preview**: see how the changes in the CMS will be reflected in the website, using the exact same code.
- UI implemented with **tailwindcss** and **Radix UI components**.
- Advanced **filtering options**
- Data fetch on **scrolling**.
- Storing filter state in **URL**.

This template is extremely easy to **customize** to your needs.

## Using the **FireCMS PRO starter template**

The easiest way to use FireCMS with Next.js is to use the **FireCMS PRO starter template**. This template includes a Next.js project with FireCMS already configured.

You can create a new project using the **FireCMS PRO template** by running:

```bash
npx create-firecms-app
```
or

```bash
yarn create firecms-app
```

and select the **`FireCMS PRO with Next.js frontend`** template.

Then follow the instructions on the screen to create your project.

### What you get

The code that will be generated for you is a Next.JS project split in **3 parts**:
- A **FireCMS instance** to manage your data.
- A **frontend app** that implements CRUD functionality for a products collection, as well as a blog view.
- A **common folder** with shared components.

## Setting up **FireCMS** with **Next.js** manually

You can use FireCMS with Next.js. FireCMS is a **React library**, so you can use it with any React framework.

In the case of Next.js, you are restricted to running FireCMS on the **client side**, as Next.js does not support server side rendering of some of the React components used by FireCMS.

Let's build an app using FireCMS and Next.js, with the app router configured to delegate all the routes starting with `/cms` to **FireCMS**.

### Create a **Next.js project**

Start by creating your Next.js project:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest
```

Select:
- **TypeScript** as the language
- **ESLint** as the linter
- **Tailwind CSS** as the CSS framework
- **src** as the root directory
- Yes to the **app router** prompt
- Yes to customize the **default import alias** (optional)

### Install **FireCMS**

Then we are going to install **FireCMS PRO**. Note that we will not be adding all the plugins like the collection editor or data enhancement, but you can add them as needed.

Then install FireCMS and its dependencies:

```bash
yarn add firebase@^10 @firecms/core@^3.0.0-beta @firecms/firebase@^3.0.0-beta @firecms/editor@^3.0.0-beta react-router@^6 react-router-dom@^6 @tailwindcss/typography typeface-rubik @fontsource/jetbrains-mono
```

Now let's import the tailwind config of FireCMS. Add the **FireCMS preset** `tailwind.config.js`, as well as the content paths to FireCMS source code, so the right tailwind classes are picked.

```js
import fireCMSConfig from "@firecms/ui/tailwind.config.js";
import type { Config } from "tailwindcss";

const config: Config = {
  presets: [fireCMSConfig],
  content: [
    "./src/pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}",
    "./src/components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}",
    "./src/app/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}",
    "./src/cms/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx,mdx}",
    "./node_modules/@firecms/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}"
  ]
};
export default config;

```

### Disable **yarn pnp** (optional)

We prefer disabling yarn pnp for this project. You can do this by creating the file `.yarnrc` in the root of your project with the following content:

```bash
nodeLinker: node-modules
```

### Configuring the **App router**

Next.js uses a file-based router. In this guide, we will be creating the FireCMS app in the `/cms` route, but you can customize this to your needs.

FireCMS uses **react-router**, so we need to configure Next.js to delegate all the routes starting with `/cms` to **FireCMS**.

In our `app` folder, we create a folder called `cms` and inside it another one called `[[...path]]`. This will match any route starting with `/cms`.

Then create the file `cms/[[...path]]/page.tsx` with the following content:
:::important
If you are not running FireCMS in the root path of your app, you need to set the `basePath` prop to the path where you are running it. In this case, we are running it in `/cms`.
:::

```tsx
"use client";
import { FireCMSApp } from "@/cms/FireCMSApp";
import { FireCMSRouter } from "@firecms/core";

export default function CMS() {
    return <FireCMSRouter basePath={"/cms"}>
        <FireCMSApp/>
    </FireCMSRouter>;
}

```

### Creating the **CMS**

Now let's create the FireCMS components. Create the file `./src/cms/FireCMSApp.tsx` with the following content. Remember to replace the `firebaseConfig` with your own Firebase configuration.

import { Code } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import importedCode from '../../samples/samples_v3/nextjs.tsx?raw';

<Code code={importedCode} lang="tsx" />

### Import the default **FireCMS styles**

Create a file called `index.css` in the `./src/cms` folder with the following content:

```css
@import "@firecms/ui/index.css";
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;

:root {
    --fcms-primary: #0070F4;
    --fcms-primary-bg: #0061e610;
    --fcms-secondary: #FF5B79;
}

a {
    @apply text-blue-600 dark:text-blue-400 dark:hover:text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-800
}
```

### Run

Then simply run:

```
yarn dev
```
and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/cms` to see your **FireCMS** app running.

### Some considerations

- Images are loaded differently in **Next.js**.
You get a `StaticImageData` instead of the image URL (as in **vite**).
You can use it in FireCMS components that expect a URL like, using the `src` property:
```tsx
import logo from "./logo.png";

<FirebaseLoginView
    logo={logo.src}/>
```
