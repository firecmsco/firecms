In order to run **FireCMS**, you need to create a Firebase project first, with
some requirements:

### Firestore

You need to enable **Firestore** in it. You can initialise the security rules
in test mode to allow reads and writes, but you are encouraged to write rules
that are suited for your domain.

Keep in mind that rules should be defined for each collection and should be
defined in a way that is suited for your domain.

Please check the [Firestore documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/security/get-started)
for more information.

:::important
In a default Firestore project, it is likely that your Firestore rules
will not allow you to read or write to the database. Continue reading to
learn how to set up your rules.
:::

For example, a simple rule that allows any authenticated user to read and write
to any collection would be:

```
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null;
    }
  }
}
```

but ideally you will want to make it more restricitve. For the products demo to work, your rules should look like this:

```
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {

    // everything is private by default
    match /{document=**} {
      allow read: if false;
      allow write: if false;
    }
    
    // allow every read to products collection but write only to authenticated users
    match /databases/{database}/documents {
        match /products/{id=**} {
          allow read: if true;
          allow write: if request.auth != null;
        }
    }
    
    // allow users to modify only their own user document
    match /users/{userId} {
      allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
    }
}

```

### Web app

In the project settings, you need to create a **Web app** within your
project, from which you can get your Firebase config as a Javascript object.
That is the object that you need to pass to the CMS.

:::tip Firebase Hosting
Note that you can also link your new webapp to **Firebase Hosting** which will
allow you to deploy it with very little effort. You can create the
Firebase Hosting site at a later stage and link it to your webapp.
:::

### Authentication

You will most likely want to enable authentication in order to pass the login
screen

:::important
Vite uses the default url `http://127.0.0.1:5173` for the development server.
Firebase Auth will require to add this url to the authorized domains in the
Firebase console.
Alternatively, you can use the url `http://localhost:5173`.

### Storage

In case you want to use the different storage fields provided by the CMS, you
need to enable **Firebase Storage**. The default bucket will be used to
save your stored files.

:::note
If you are experiencing any CORS issues, you can enable CORS in your bucket
settings as specified in: https://firebase.google.com/docs/storage/web/download-files#cors_configuration
Create a file with the content:

```
[
  {
    "origin": ["*"],
    "method": ["GET"],
    "maxAgeSeconds": 3600
  }
]
```

and upload it with: `gsutil cors set cors.json gs://<your-cloud-storage-bucket>`.
