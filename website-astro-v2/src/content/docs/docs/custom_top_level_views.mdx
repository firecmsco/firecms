If you need to develop a custom view that does not map directly to a datasource
collection you can implement it as a React component. This is useful for
implementing custom dashboards, data visualizations, or any other custom
functionality you need.

The top level views can be customized based on the logged in user, so you can
implement custom views for different user roles, or even hide them completely
for unauthenticated users.

You can use all the components and hooks provided by FireCMS.
Check the [components gallery](./components) for more information.

You can also use all the hooks, including authentication, navigation, datasource (Firestore),
storage, etc.

You can also include collection views inside your custom views, or use the side panel
to see entity details, or use with completely custom components.

You need to define the name, route and the component, and add it to the main
navigation, as the example below.

By default, it will show in the main navigation view.

For custom views you can define the following props:

* `path` string

CMS Path you can reach this view from.
If you include multiple paths, only the first one will be included in the
main menu

* `name`: string

Name of this view

* `description`?: string

Optional description of this view. You can use Markdown

* `hideFromNavigation`?: boolean

Should this view be hidden from the main navigation panel.
It will still be accessible if you reach the specified path

* `view`: React.ReactNode

Component to be rendered. This can be any React component, and can use any
of the provided hooks

* `group`?: string

Optional field used to group top level navigation entries under a
navigation view.


### Example self-hosted FireCMS

For self-hosted FireCMS, you can define your custom top level views by adding them in your `useBuildNavigationController` component.
You can pass them as an array of `CMSView` objects or a callback function that returns an array of `CMSView` objects.
In the callback, you can use the `user` object to conditionally show or hide views based on the user role, as well
as access the `authentication` and `navigation` hooks.

```tsx
import {CMSView, useBuildNavigationController} from "@firecms/core";
import {useMemo} from "react";

// rest of you main app code

    const customViews: CMSView[] = useMemo([{
        path: "additional",
        name: "Additional view",
        description: "This is an example of an additional view that is defined by the user",
        // This can be any React component
        view: <ExampleCMSView/>
    }], []);

    const navigationController = useBuildNavigationController({
        views: ({ user }) =>{
            if(!user) {
                return [];
            }
            return customViews;
        },
        collections,
        authController,
        dataSourceDelegate: firestoreDelegate
    });
```


### Example FireCMS Cloud

In FireCMS Cloud, you can define your custom top level views by adding them to your `FireCMSAppConfig`. You can
use a callback or add them directly to the `views` property. The callback includes the logged in `user`, so you can
use it to conditionally show or hide views based on the user role.

import CustomViewSampleCloud from "!!raw-loader!../samples/samples_v3/custom_cms_view/CustomViewSampleCloud";
import ExampleCMSView from "!!raw-loader!../samples/samples_v3/custom_cms_view/ExampleCMSView";

<CodeBlock language="tsx">{CustomViewSampleCloud}</CodeBlock>



### Example Additional view

Your custom view is implemented as any regular React component.
You can use any of the provided hooks, including authentication, navigation, datasource, storage, app stage, etc.
