In this section we will demonstrate some advanced use cases that can be solved
with the multiple features provided by FireCMS.

For example, we can build the data structure for a **blog** that you can
then render using SSR (server side rendering) with a tool like
next.js for blazing fast performance and SEO.

In one of the recipes we show you how to add custom logic to copy entities 
from one collection to another.

Another usual problem is handling **localizations**, so we show you
how to create a data structure that works both for developers and content
creators.
