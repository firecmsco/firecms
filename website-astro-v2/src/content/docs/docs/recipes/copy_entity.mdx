description: Implement custom functionality to copy entities between collections in Firestore using FireCMS with this practical tutorial. Assuming you're equipped with a Firebase project and FireCMS instance, you'll learn how to introduce a copy button to your collection views, enabling the replication of data across different Firestore locations, a helpful feature in denormalized NoSQL databases. This guide walks you through declaring source and target collections, crafting a custom button component leveraging FireCMS hooks, and integrating it as a custom action within your collection's framework. Complete with code snippets illustrating a simple product collection and the custom button logic, this tutorial equips you to handle common scenarios requiring data duplication, enhancing the data management capabilities of your CMS. Whether you're dealing with products, articles, or user data, mastering entity copying can streamline your workflow and maintain data consistency across your FireCMS application.

In this tutorial we will show how you can add a button to your collection,
that will allow you to **copy entities from another collection**.

It is very common in NoSQL databases, such as Firestore, to keep denormalized
data in different collections. That is, keeping the same information in multiple
locations, instead of normalized databases where information should be ideally
stored only once.

### Declare your collections

For illustrative purposes, let's create two simple `products` collection,
that we will be copying from and to:



import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import MyComponentSource from "!!raw-loader!../../samples/samples_v3/recipes/copy_entity/simple_product_collection";
import CopyButton from "!!raw-loader!../../samples/samples_v3/recipes/copy_entity/copy_button";
import CopyButtonUse from "!!raw-loader!../../samples/samples_v3/recipes/copy_entity/copy_button_use";
import FullCode from "!!raw-loader!../../samples/samples_v3/recipes/copy_entity/full";

<CodeBlock language="tsx">{MyComponentSource}</CodeBlock>

### Add a custom action to your collection

For the next step we will add a custom button to our target collection.
This button will open a reference dialog and allow users to select an entity in
the source.

This example is using some hooks provided by FireCMS for developing
custom component.



<CodeBlock language="tsx">{CopyButton}</CodeBlock>

### Add the custom copy action

After your component is ready, you can plug it into your collections `Actions`:



<CodeBlock language="tsx">{CopyButtonUse}</CodeBlock>

<CodeBlock language="tsx">{FullCode}</CodeBlock>
