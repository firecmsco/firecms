We are developing a custom backend for FireCMS that is based on PostgreSQL and Drizzle ORM. 
This backend will be used to store and manage data for FireCMS applications, providing a robust and scalable solution for developers.

In the current stage, the backend is under the folder app/backend.
The source is split into 'lib' and 'example' folders.

The 'lib' folder will be the core library that can be used in any FireCMS application.
The 'example' folder will contain an example application that uses the library for development and testing purposes.
