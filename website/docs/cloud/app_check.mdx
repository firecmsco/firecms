You can integrate Firebase App Check with your app to protect your backend resources from abuse, such as billing fraud
or phishing. Firebase App Check works alongside other Firebase services, such as Firebase Authentication,
to help secure your backend resources.

FireCMS provides a simple way to integrate Firebase App Check with your app. You can enable it by providing the
`appCheck` prop in your app configuration.

You can define some options:
- `provider`: The provider you want to use.
- `isTokenAutoRefreshEnabled`: Whether to automatically refresh the token.
- `debugToken`: A debug token to use.
- `forceRefresh`: Whether to force a token refresh.



## Providers

The `provider` property is required and should be an instance of a Firebase AppCheck provider.
You can use one of the following providers:

### ReCaptchaEnterpriseProvider

In order to set up the ReCaptchaEnterpriseProvider, you need to create a new reCAPTCHA Enterprise site key.
Follow the instructions in the [Firebase documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/app-check/web/recaptcha-enterprise-provider).

:::important
Make sure you have added the domain `app.firecms.co` to the list of allowed domains in the reCAPTCHA Enterprise console.
:::

```tsx
import {FireCMSAppConfig} from "@firecms/cloud";
import {ReCaptchaEnterpriseProvider} from "@firebase/app-check";

const appConfig: FireCMSAppConfig = {

    version: "1",

    appCheck: {
        provider: new ReCaptchaEnterpriseProvider("your-site-key")
    },
}

export default appConfig;
```

### ReCaptchaV3Provider

In order to set up the ReCaptchaV3Provider, you need to create a new reCAPTCHA v3 site key.
Follow the instructions in the [Firebase documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/app-check/web/recaptcha-provider).

```tsx
import {FireCMSAppConfig} from "@firecms/cloud";
import {ReCaptchaV3Provider} from "@firebase/app-check";

const appConfig: FireCMSAppConfig = {

    version: "1",

    appCheck: {
        provider: new ReCaptchaV3Provider("your-site-key")
    },
}

export default appConfig;
```

### Custom provider

You can also create a custom provider by implementing the `AppCheckProvider` interface.


## Check your configuration

FireCMS Cloud can share dependencies with your uploaded app. It is important than your app and FireCMS Cloud use the same version of Firebase App Check.
In order to do so, make sure, in your `vite.config.ts`, you are using the shared dependency provided by FireCMS.
You need to have the dependency `@firebase/app-check` in your `vite.config.ts`. Federation plugin `shared` configuration.

This is a sample configuration:

```tsx
import { defineConfig } from "vite"
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react"
import federation from "@originjs/vite-plugin-federation"

// https://vitejs.dev/config/
export default defineConfig({
    esbuild: {
        logOverride: { "this-is-undefined-in-esm": "silent" }
    },
    plugins: [
        react(),
        federation({
            name: "remote_app",
            filename: "remoteEntry.js",
            exposes: {
                "./config": "./src/index"
            },
            shared: [
                "react",
                "react-dom",
                "@firecms/cloud",
                "@firecms/core",
                "@firecms/firebase",
                "@firecms/ui",
                "@firebase/firestore",
                "@firebase/app",
                "@firebase/functions",
                "@firebase/auth",
                "@firebase/storage",
                "@firebase/analytics",
                "@firebase/remote-config",
                "@firebase/app-check" // Add this line
            ]
        })
    ],
    build: {
        modulePreload: false,
        minify: false,
        target: "esnext",
        cssCodeSplit: false,
    }
});
```
