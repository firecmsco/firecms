:::note
Please note that in order to use FireCMS as described in this quickstart guide,
you need an existing Firebase project with features enabled, such as Google
authentication, Firestore and Firebase storage.
Check the [Firebase setup section](firebase_setup.md) if you need additional
support
:::

Let's build a very simple CMS that creates a collection of products, with
some properties. It includes samples of some advanced features, such as
dynamic conditional fields or references (to the same products' collection,
for simplicity).

We are defining our `Product` type for better type checking and code clarity,
but it is not compulsory.

Authentication and authorization are also enabled, and make use of the `extra`
field in the `authController` to check for permissions.

#### Create a new React app including Typescript:

```
yarn create vite my-cms --template react-ts
```

#### Go into the new directory:

```
cd my-cms
```

#### Install FireCMS and it's peer dependencies:

```
yarn add @camberi/firecms@next firebase@^9 @mui/material@^5 @mui/icons-material@^5 @mui/lab@latest @mui/x-date-pickers@^5.0.0-beta.1 @emotion/react @emotion/styled react-router@^6 react-router-dom@^6
```

You can then replace the content of the file App.tsx with the following sample code.

Remember to **replace** the Firebase config with the one you get after creating
a webapp in the Firebase console.

If you don't know where to find the Firebase app config, check the
[Firebase setup](firebase_setup.md) section

import CodeBlock from "@theme/CodeBlock";
import MyComponentSource from "!!raw-loader!firecms-example/src/docs/SimpleApp";

<CodeBlock language="tsx">{MyComponentSource}</CodeBlock>

#### Run

Then simply run:

```
yarn dev
```

You should be able to see your FireCMS instance in your browser, awesome!
