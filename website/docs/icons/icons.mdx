When building a UI, it's often necessary to include icons to represent different actions, states, or content.
FireCMS uses **Material Design icons**, which are available for free from Google. These icons are conveniently
packed as independent React components, which can be used in your own components.

In some cases you might need to use the icons as components, for example in a button. In other cases, you might
need to specify the icon key.

In this view you can see all the available icons and their keys. Just **search** for the icon you need!
