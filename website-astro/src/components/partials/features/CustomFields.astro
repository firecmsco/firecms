    <p class="text-xl md:text-2xl">
        FireCMS provides around <b>20 default fields</b> which should suffice for most business logic. These fields
        range from simple text fields or selects to more complex ones like file uploaders, date pickers, or
        reference fields. There are also hundreds of validation options available, as well as the ability to create
        custom validators.
    </p>
    <p class="text-xl md:text-2xl">
        However, sometimes you may need more complex editing forms and specific fields that the default ones don't
        cover. In these cases, you can create your own custom fields and use them in your entity collection.
