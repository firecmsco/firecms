sidebar_label: Migrating from v3.0 to v3.1
description: Upgrade your FireCMS Cloud custom code to v3.1 — Tailwind CSS v4, React 19, and new collection views.
---

This migration guide applies to **FireCMS Cloud** projects that deploy custom code using the CLI
(`firecms deploy`).

## Do I Need to Do Anything?

**All FireCMS Cloud users get every new feature automatically** — Kanban board, Cards view,
AI collection generation, and more are already live in your project. No update needed.

If you deploy **custom code** via the CLI (`firecms deploy`), your existing build will continue to
work exactly as before. However, we strongly encourage you to update your local dependencies to
Tailwind CSS v4 and React 19. React 18 is still supported today, but **will be deprecated in a
future release**, so updating now will save you effort later.

---

## Recommended Updates

### Update FireCMS Packages

Update all `@firecms/*` packages in your `package.json` to version **3.1**:

```bash
npm i @firecms/cloud@3.1.0
```

---

### Migrate to Tailwind CSS v4

FireCMS 3.1 ships with **Tailwind CSS v4** support. While your existing Tailwind v3 setup will
continue to work, we recommend upgrading for faster builds and simpler configuration.

#### 1. Install Tailwind CSS v4 and the Vite plugin

```bash
npm i tailwindcss@4 @tailwindcss/vite
```

#### 2. Update your `vite.config.ts`

Add the new Tailwind CSS Vite plugin:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import react from "@vitejs/plugin-react";
import tailwindcss from "@tailwindcss/vite";

export default defineConfig({
    esbuild: {
        logOverride: { "this-is-undefined-in-esm": "silent" }
    },
    build: {
        outDir: "./build",
        target: "ESNEXT",
        sourcemap: true
    },
    optimizeDeps: { include: ["react/jsx-runtime"] },
    plugins: [
        react({}),
        tailwindcss()
    ]
})
```

#### 3. Update your `index.css`

Replace your existing CSS with the new v4 format:

```css
@import "tailwindcss";
@import "@firecms/ui/index.css";

@source "../index.html";
@source "./**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}";
@source "../node_modules/@firecms/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}";

@custom-variant dark (:is(.dark &));

:root {
    --color-primary: #0070F4;
    --color-secondary: #FF5B79;
}
```

:::note
The old CSS variable names (`--fcms-primary`, `--fcms-primary-dark`, `--fcms-primary-bg`) have been
replaced. Use `--color-primary` and `--color-secondary` instead — dark and background variants are
now computed automatically.
:::

#### 4. Clean up old config files

Remove these files from your project — they are no longer needed:
- `tailwind.config.js`
- `postcss.config.js`

---

### Upgrade to React 19

FireCMS 3.1 supports **React 19** while maintaining backward compatibility with React 18.3.
We recommend upgrading now — **React 18 support will be removed in a future release**.

```bash
npm i react@19 react-dom@19
npm i -D @types/react@19 @types/react-dom@19
```

:::tip
If you see TypeScript errors like `Cannot find namespace 'JSX'` after upgrading, replace explicit
`JSX.Element` return types with `React.ReactElement` or remove the return type annotation entirely.
:::

---

## What's New in v3.1

These features are already available in your FireCMS Cloud project — no update required:

- **Kanban Board view** — drag-and-drop entities grouped by enum properties
- **Cards view** — visual card layout for content-heavy collections
- **AI Collection Generation** — generate schemas from natural language
- **Drag-and-drop column reordering** — rearrange table columns by dragging, order is saved automatically
- **Duplicate collections** — clone an existing collection to create a new one with the same schema
- **Entity History improvements** — previous values, "last edited by" indicator, per-collection toggles
- **New filter UI** — redesigned filter view for a cleaner experience
- **Timezone support for dates** — correct timezone handling, no more midnight auto-conversion
- **Enum conditions** — dynamically filter enum values based on other properties
- **Collapsible drawer groups** — cleaner sidebar navigation
- **TipTap V3** — improved rich-text editor
- **Image resizing** — built-in image resizing on upload

For custom code projects, updating also unlocks:

- **Tailwind CSS v4** — faster builds, simpler config
- **React 19** — latest React features and performance

Check the [changelog](/docs/changelog) for the complete list of changes.

## Troubleshooting

### Build errors after updating packages
Ensure **all** `@firecms/*` packages are on the same version. Mixing v3.0 and v3.1 packages will
cause type mismatches and runtime errors.

### Styles not applying after Tailwind v4 migration
- Verify your `index.css` includes the `@source` directives for your project files and `node_modules/@firecms`
- Ensure you removed the old `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js`
- Clear your `node_modules` folder and reinstall: `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`

### `Cannot find namespace 'JSX'`
Update your return type annotations from `JSX.Element` to `React.ReactElement` or remove the
explicit return type and let TypeScript infer it.
