description: Get started with self-hosted FireCMS in minutes. Create a new project using the CLI and run it locally.
---

Build your own **Firebase admin panel** and **headless CMS** with full control over your infrastructure. FireCMS self-hosted versions let you deploy a powerful **React-based back-office** on your own servers, with complete data ownership.

:::tip When to choose self-hosted?
- **Data sovereignty**: Your data never leaves your infrastructure
- **Custom backends**: Use **MongoDB**, custom APIs, or any database
- **Deep customization**: Full access to extend every part of the CMS
- **On-premise requirements**: Deploy behind firewalls or in private clouds
:::

### Community vs PRO

| Feature | Community (Free) | PRO |
|---------|-----------------|-----|
| Full CRUD UI | ✅ | ✅ |
| Custom React fields | ✅ | ✅ |
| TypeScript support | ✅ | ✅ |
| Collection Editor UI | ❌ | ✅ |
| Data import/export | ❌ | ✅ |
| LLM autocompletion | ❌ | ✅ |
| User & role management | ❌ | ✅ |

Both versions are built on **React**, connect to **Firebase/Firestore** (or MongoDB), and give you a production-ready **admin panel** in minutes.


### Create a new project using the CLI

To create a new project using the CLI, you can run the following command:
```bash
npx create-firecms-app
```
or:

```bash
yarn create firecms-app
```


This will create a new FireCMS, Community or PRO, project in the selected folder.
A FireCMS project is a React application that you can customize to fit your needs.
The initial project will have a basic structure with a few collections and a couple of custom views.

### Running the project

To run the project, you run the following commands:

```bash
cd my-cms
yarn
yarn dev
```

or

```bash
cd my-cms
npm install
npm run dev
```

This will install the dependencies and start the development server.

### Changing the base URL of FireCMS

FireCMS uses React Router to handle the routing of the application.
You can change the base URL of FireCMS by modifying the `basename` property of the `BrowserRouter` component in the `src/main.tsx` file.
For example, if you want to change the base URL to `/admin`, you can do it like this:

```tsx
import React from "react"
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import { BrowserRouter } from "react-router-dom";

import "./index.css"
import App from "./App";

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root") as HTMLElement).render(
    <React.StrictMode>
        <BrowserRouter basename={"/admin"}>
            <App/>
        </BrowserRouter>
    </React.StrictMode>
)
```
