Dialog components are used to present content in a layer above the app's main content, and they often request a user response. They are a critical component for modal dialogs, lightboxes, notification pop-ups, and custom content popups.

## Usage

To use the `Dialog`, import it from your components and pass the necessary props including `open`, `onOpenChange`, and the dialog's content as children. Optionally, you can customize its appearance with `className`, `fullWidth`, `fullHeight`, `fullScreen`, `scrollable`, `maxWidth`, `modal`, and `onOpenAutoFocus` props.

:::caution
You need to provide a `DialogTitle` in your `Dialog` component to ensure that the dialog is accessible.
You will see a warning in the console if you forget to provide a `DialogTitle`.
