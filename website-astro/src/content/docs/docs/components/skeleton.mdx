The `Skeleton` component is used as a placeholder while content is loading. It provides a simple visual representation of the component that is being loaded, typically as a gray or light-colored block.

## Usage

To use the `Skeleton`, import it from your components and pass the `width`, `height`, and `className` props to customize its appearance.

import CodeSampleWithSource from "../../../../components/CodeSampleWithSource.astro";

## Basic Skeleton

A simple skeleton with default width and height.

<CodeSampleWithSource path="/src/content/docs/samples/components/skeleton/skeleton_basic.tsx"/>

## Custom Sized Skeleton

A skeleton component that showcases custom width and height.

<CodeSampleWithSource path="/src/content/docs/samples/components/skeleton/skeleton_custom_size.tsx"/>

## Skeleton With Custom Classes

Demonstrates usage of the `className` prop to apply custom styles.

<CodeSampleWithSource path="/src/content/docs/samples/components/skeleton/skeleton_custom_class.tsx"/>
