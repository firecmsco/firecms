Badges are small counts and labeling components used to add additional information to any content. They're commonly used to display unread counts, status indicators, or just as decorative nodes.

## Basic Badge

By setting the `invisible` prop to `true`, you can hide the badge, making it not visible to users.

<CodeSampleWithSource path="/src/content/docs/samples/components/badge/badge_invisible.tsx"/>

## Color Variants

The `color` prop determines the color of the badge. Possible values are `primary`, `secondary`, and `error`.

## Usage with Icons and Buttons

Badges can be wrapped around icons or buttons to provide status indicators.
