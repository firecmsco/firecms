`ExpandablePanel` is a versatile component that allows for content to be collapsible, enhancing the organization of UI by hiding content that is not immediately relevant to the user. This component can operate in controlled or uncontrolled mode, with additional features such as an invisible mode for a subtler UI, and an optional field mode to align with form field styling.

## Usage

To use the `ExpandablePanel`, import it from your components and provide the necessary props including `title`, `children`, and control props like `expanded`, `onExpandedChange`, and styling props such as `titleClassName`, `className`.
