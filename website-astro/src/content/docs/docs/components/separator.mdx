Separators are used to visually distinguish content in a layout or list. They can be either horizontal or vertical, making them versatile for various design needs.

## Usage

To use the `Separator`, import it from your components and specify the `orientation` and optionally, the `decorative` prop to control its appearance.

import CodeSampleWithSource from "../../../../components/CodeSampleWithSource.astro";

## Horizontal Separator

A separator that spans horizontally, useful for dividing content like list items or sections in a layout.

<CodeSampleWithSource path="/src/content/docs/samples/components/separator/separator_horizontal.tsx"/>

## Decorative Separator

Demonstrates how to use the `decorative` prop to render a separator that is meant for visual or decorative purposes rather than semantic division of content.

<CodeSampleWithSource path="/src/content/docs/samples/components/separator/separator_decorative.tsx"/>
